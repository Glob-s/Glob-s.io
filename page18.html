She completed her Ph.D. in Strategic Management at  INSEAD, and previously received a M.A. in Development Economics and a B.A. in Political Science from the Paris Institute of Political Science (Sciences Po).
<br><br>Her research explains how firms can form cross-sector partnerships (i.e., with public and non-profit sector organizations) to create and capture value in emerging markets. Her work sheds light on the mechanisms through which such cross-sector collaborations can successfully enhance the knowledge and capabilities of partner organizations by adressing socio-economic and political challenges to their operations. Her research connects individuals, the organizations they belong to and the institutional environments of emerging markets.  The empirical settings that Aline studies include cosmetics and banking in Brazil, logistics and healthcare partnerships in Africa, Latin America and Asia, Corporate Social Responsibility in India, and corporate disaster response worldwide.
<br><br>Her research and pedagogical case studies on this topic have been recognized with several awards, including the Strategic Management Society Best PhD Paper Award and the European Foundation for Management Development case study competition award. She currently serves on the Editorial Board of the Strategic Management Journal.</p>
